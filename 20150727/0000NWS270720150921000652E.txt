Remark                                   :
          According to The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) announced that 
Patkol Public Company Limited (PK) subject to the possible delisting since March
10, 2010 onwards due to the company's financial statements of December 31, 2009
showed a minus shareholders' equity amounting to Baht 1,030 million. PK has
requested the SET for approval to remove the causes of possible delisting and
resume its securities to be traded. Therefore, the SET removes causes of
possible delisting of the securities by lifting "SP" (Suspension) and NC
(Non-Compliance) signs and resumes its trading on the Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) under Industrials Group in Industrial Materials & Machinery Sector, from
July 28, 2015 onwards. In addition, the SET will temporarily lift the daily
price limit of PK's securities on July 28, 2015 to allow the market mechanism to
 work properly (Details as shown on SET's news on July 17,  2015)
          PK has been under rehabilitation through bankruptcy court in the 
preceding period, the company had its financial restructuring. Hence, the latest
price at Baht 0.40 per share on May 7, 2010 might not reflect the securities'
actual value at the present. The SET requests shareholders and investors to
scrutinize PK's information before making investment decision.
